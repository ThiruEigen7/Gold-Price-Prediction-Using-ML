Gold Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

About the Project:

In this project, I used a gold price dataset covering the period from 2008 to 2018. The dataset includes the date, S&P 500 stock prices, USO (United States Oil Fund) prices, gold prices, silver prices, and the Euro/US Dollar exchange rate. These factors influence the price of gold. I analyzed the dataset using Python libraries and learned a lot during the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) process, experimenting with various functions. I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize both the predicted and feature data.

10 Important Steps for Prediction Using Machine Learning:

    Data Collection: Obtain the dataset.
    Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the data through visualizations.
    Split Data: Separate the data into training and test sets.
    Model Selection: Choose an appropriate model.
    Model Training: Train the model.
    Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics.
    Make Predictions: Use the model to predict new data.
    Model Deployment: Optionally deploy the model.

okk.where is 10th step???
Mathematics:)

Before starting the project, it's crucial to understand which tools and functions will be used. You don't need to know every function, but you should be familiar with the ones relevant to this project.
